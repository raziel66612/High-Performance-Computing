> Code for mandelbrot set is written in C++

>  open and run `mandelbrot.cc` using `g++ mandelbrot.cc -o mandelbrot` on terminal to generate an object file and run the executable by `./mandelbrot` on terminal.

>  code from `mandelbrot.cc` should generate two files:
> - first file is written in **.ppm** format, this file is for visualization purpose (few of the viewer that open **.ppm** are GIMP, adobe photoshop with CartaPGM, Netpbm, XnViewMP.)
> - Second File is written is a **.txt** file, this file gives you all the necessary information on the input parameter used in mandelbrot set and also the displays the area of the generated mandelbrot set for that particular input paramters.

> I have been using GIMP to view '.ppm', also i have exported '.JPEG' file for each '.ppm' file for each grid resolution for your critique.
