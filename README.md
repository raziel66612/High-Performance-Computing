# High-Performance-Computing
This folder contains code and results i created while completing my Graduate course "High Performance Computing 1".
Please refer to "readme.md" in each folder, which would further elaborate on all the details.

> Directory `CalculatePie_via_MPI` have 4 cases in respective sub-directories.

> Directory `Mandelbrot_set` have a serialcode for mandelbrot written in C++

> Directory `Mandelbrot_set_MPI` have 2 subcases:
>> - Case 1 : mandelbrot domain is divided in 2 parts vertically and each part is solved by 2 seperate processor and finally a full size image is generated by reducing and accumulating all the calculations.
>> - Case 2 : mandelbrot domain is divided in 4 parts horizontally and each part is solved by 4 seperate processor and finally a full size image is generated by reducing and accumulating all the calculations.

> Direcotory `petsc_code` contains codes i wrote while learning petsc basics
