## Parallelizing mandelbrot set using **MPI** (Message Passing interface)

> all my code is written in c++.

>present directory have 2 folders for caseA and caseB each having a domain split by 2 and 4 cores respectives

> after writing code in `.cc` extension, we first load 2 module to run mpi using commands `module load intel/17.0` and `module load intel-mpi/2017.0.1` then generate the object file with command `mpiicpc mandelbrot.cc -o mandelbrot.mpi` on terminal
>> once the object file is generated we write the slurm script and save with name "qmandelbrot.sh", this slurm script includes the path to the above generated object file.
>>>then to submit the job we use command `sbatch ./qmandelbrot.sh`

>or alternatively, create object file with `mpiicpc mandelbrot.cc -o mandelbrot.mpi` and then use
>> - `mpiexec -n 3 ./mandelbrot.mpi` for case A
>> - `mpiexec -n 5 ./mandelbrot.mpi` for case B

>1. caseA generates 1 output file with extension ".out" , if you use command "cat JOB####.out", you should see the output result which has the area of the mandelbrot
>2. caseA also should generate 3 image file in ".ppm" format, i have also included the converted jpg files for each ppm files
>3. .ppm file generated by rank1 should have LHS of mandelbrot
>4. .ppm file generated by rank2 should have RHS of mandelbrot
>5. .ppm file generated by rank0 should have whole mandelbrot

>1. in caseB we split the mandelbrot part in to 4 parts and combine them.
>2. caseB also generates 1 output file with extension ".out" , if you use command "cat JOB####.out", you should see the output result which has area of the mandelbrot
>3. similarly caseB generates 5 .ppm file (corresponding jpg have also been uploaded for convenience of opening img file), each of 4 ppm file generated by the processors have thier respective part of the domain and 5th file generated by rank0 has the whole image file.
